# MassRemoveArcs

This plugin allows you to quickly remove all selected arcs.

If this is already built in I am very smart.
I made this purely because I had to remove like 100 arcs manually since I didn't realize I made them accidentally and then closed the program.

To use simply select arcs then press tab and press remove arc button.
